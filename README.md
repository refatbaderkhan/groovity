# Groovity

Groovity is my second significant project following [Rentable](https://github.com/refatbaderkhan/rentable-client). In this project, I aim to merge my passion for coding and music, creating a space where I can learn and experiment with new technologies. The ultimate objective is to craft an optimal music platform that aligns with my preferences, envisioning a platform I would love to use in the future.

I will continuously update this readme file to document my thought process, trials, and have a record to reflect upon once the project is completed.
