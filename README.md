# Groovity

Groovity is my second significant project following [Rentable](https://github.com/refatbaderkhan/rentable-client). In this project, I aim to merge my passion for coding and music, creating a space where I can learn and experiment with new technologies. The ultimate objective is to craft an optimal music platform that aligns with my preferences, envisioning a platform I would love to use in the future.

I will continuously update this readme file to document my thought process, trials, and have a record to reflect upon once the project is completed.

#### Tech Stack

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js

#### Server Repo

[Groovity Server](https://github.com/refatbaderkhan/groovity-server)


#### UI/UX Design

I'm trying to take inspiration from many music services to make the website as smooth and aesthetically pleasing as possible without spending a lot of time on the design as it's not the goal of the initial phase of this project. Here's the [Design Figma File](https://www.figma.com/file/RunYjeTBpcmb2JEwHP287F/Groovity?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=9bcYH6dqdfHqUrGG-1) that will be continously updated through out the project

#### Technologies Used

It's still tricky to choose which MERN complementary technologies to support the website and make the project more professional. I will keep updating this list as I'm discovering and implementing :
- Spotify Web API
- Shadcn UI Library
- Tailwind CSS Framework
